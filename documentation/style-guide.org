#+TITLE: Style Guide

* Naming
  Based on the naming scheme used in FreeRTOS, with some differences.
  + Underscores to separate words.
  + Lowercase
  + Nouns First: Eg, "v_catalog_build" is better than "v_build_catalog"
  + Prefix all variable and function names with a type, such as ~l~ for long, ~pi~ for pointer to
    integer, ~s~ for string (pointer to character), or ~x~ (custom type, such as a struct).

  For example, the correct signature for a function that finds the length of a string is ~int
  i_string_length(const char *s_input)~
* Layout
  + 4 spaces for indentation
  + Aligning equals signs, field names in a struct, etc is recommended.
  + All variable declarations (except for loop variables) at the top of their function.
  + Max line length: 100, try to keep to 90 when possible.
