#+TITLE: The Open Star Tracking Framework

This is a framework for developing high-accuracy star trackers on small, low-power, low-cost
satellites. It is being developed in the Husky Satellite Lab, a cubesat team at the University of
Washington.

* Parts of a Star Tracking System
  + Undistortion or cropping: It's critical for captured images to be "flat". Unfortunately, real
    world lenses make things look a little less than flat. Algorithms can undistort images or simply
    crop out the edges to remove the areas where distortion is the worst.

    Our framework does...
    - [ ] Undistortion Routines (probably should happen after centroiding)
    - [ ] Cropping Routines (that keep track of how FOV changes due to crop)
    - [ ] Noise removal (median of images from many angles)
  + Centroiding: Each star in the photo should be reduced to a single point, with sub-pixel
    accuracy. Auxiliary data, such as star brightness or the likelihood it is a binary star, may be
    collected too.

    Our framework does...
    - [ ] Simple centroiding (mean-based?)
    - [ ] Gaussian centroiding
    - [ ] Coordinate Conversion (from pixelâ†”celestial sphere)
  + Catalog Building: This happens on the ground. The format of this catalog depends a lot on the
    Star Identification algorithm used. It might contain information about distances to adjacent
    stars, expected brightness, etc. One thing all catalogs have in common is the actual spherical
    coordinates of the stars, so that once the stars have been identified, the spacecraft's actual
    attitude can be determined.

    Our framework does...
    - [ ] Downloading the latest versions of various catalogs in generic format.
    - [ ] Generic API for accessing data from those catalogs to produce customized catalogs.
    - [ ] Several catalog-building routines for common Star-ID algorithms.
  + Star Identification: The "main" step of star tracking: Going from a list star positions (and
    possibly magnitudes or other info)

    Our framework does...
    - [ ] Padgett Grid identification method with variations:
      - [ ] Flower Method
      - [ ] Sequential Sum method
    - [ ] Pyramid method
    - [ ] Geometric Voting
    - [ ] Uncalibrated K-vectory method
    - [ ] Star-ND or Liebe
    - [ ] LIS, Tracking, and Uncalibrated modes
  + Attitude Determination: Once enough stars have been identified, they can be combined with
    information on camera parameters to determine the attitude.

    Our framework does...
    - [ ] Attitude Determination (QUEST?)

  Other parts of our framework that are not essential parts of a star-tracking system:
  - [ ] Centroiding Visualization
  - [ ] Algorithm Visualizations
  - [ ] Re-projection of starts after fix visualization
  - [ ] Benchmarking against reference images
  - [ ] Demo App that acquires a fix, calibrates the camera, then tracks, with real-time
    visualizations. Would be really cool to make it work on a phone!
  - [ ] Automatic corruption of images to test noise tolerance. Star removal, false star adding,
    moon and earth and sun adding, optical offset, focal length mismatch.
